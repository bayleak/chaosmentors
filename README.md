# chaosmentors
This is going to be a User-Signup system for the Chaosmentors Project, available at several CCC Events.

Currently there is nothing to try out. 
The system in it's current state is not useable.

Expect a rudimentary working version around the 32C3 (Dec 2015)

The System will be based on the quite popular web2py Framework. This means the Chaosmentors will not be a standalone software. Instead it will be a regular web2py-Application, which you can install in the usual way.
Extensive usage and installation instructions will follow, as soon as the system is in a working state.
